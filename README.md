# STFN : Swin Transformer Fusion Network for Image Quality Assessment
https://github.com/Hyeongmyeon-Kim/STFN



> **Abstract:** *Image quality assessment (IQA) is essential for evaluating images generated by image restoration and generative AI algorithms. It can be categorized as full reference IQA (FR-IQA) and no reference IQA (NR-IQA), depending on the presence of reference images. IQA methods aims to mimic the human visual system for quality assessment. The development of algorithms that can evaluate various kinds of distortions has become challenging with the emergence of generative AI models such as GAN. In this thesis, we propose a deep learning model for IQA, which convey global information into local information and transfers feature maps between separated layers of the swin transformer. Additionally, we propose an IQA model that utilizes the resolution and distortion information by performing operations between feature maps of different sizes in the separated layers of the swin transformer. In experimental results, we demonstrate that the proposed IQA method is more effective for various image datasets including those generated by generative AI models compared with the previous methods.*
